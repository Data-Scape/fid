        Polyphemus' humble beginnings stretch back to the Fountain Bar in Folsom, CA playing shows every Friday night for the local crowd. Among many of the other bands, however, none became more successful than the motley crew of Michael Carson, Gregory Allison, Jason Lot, and Margret Hull. They now travel the country and share their music to new listeners and familiar-faced dream punkers.<br>
        <br>
        Now under the release of their second studio album <i>"The Valley of the Nightbloom"</i>, Michael Carson shares with us the many doubts, pains, and hardships that have come to pass in light of the band's unionship.
