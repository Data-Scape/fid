        <p>Dear listeners,<p>
          <blockquote>
            Unfortunately, due to the nature of the Covid-19 situation we will not be able to continue our <b>Nightbloom</b> cross-country tour. Effective immediately, we will be rescheduling <i>all</i> dates between <b>March 11th to July 30th</b> at which <b>all tickets will be valid for their reschedule date.</b><br><br>
            We understand that this may disappoint you guys, but we care about the well-being of our fans more than anything. It would be irresponsible to bring you guys into an unsafe enviroment that would endanger you.<br><br>
            While we work on bringing everyone back up on their feet, <b>just stay safe, care for yourselves, and care for eachother</b> in these strange times.
          </blockquote>
        <p>Much love,<br>
          Maggie, Thomas, and Julius
